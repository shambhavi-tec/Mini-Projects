# 🎵 Spotify Clone – Frontend Practice Project

This project is an **exact clone of the Spotify Web Player UI**, built only for **practicing frontend development skills**.  
It replicates the layout, structure, and look of Spotify’s interface using **HTML** and **CSS**.  

⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This is a non-commercial practice project. I have taken some **creative liberties**.

## 🧠 Personal Challenges

- Recreating the **sticky bottom music player** and ensuring it stayed responsive across screen sizes.  
- Aligning the **middle section (albums & playlists)** was tricky because the images had different dimensions. I had to adjust the styling to maintain a consistent card layout.  
- Since Spotify uses **custom-made icons and fonts**, I had to substitute them with **Font Awesome icons** and **Google Fonts (Montserrat)** while keeping the layout as close as possible to the original.
