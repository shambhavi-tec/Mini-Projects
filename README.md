# Mini-Projects  

This repository is a collection of small frontend projects I’ve built while practicing web development.  
Each project is **self-contained** with its own **index.html**, **style.css**, supporting assets, and a dedicated **README.md** that explains the details of that specific project.  

I’ll continue adding more projects here as I learn and explore new concepts.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  

- **HTML5**  
- **CSS3**  
- **JavaScript** (where applicable)  

---

## 📌 Notes  

- These projects are created purely for **learning and practice purposes**.  
- Logos, icons, or assets used in certain projects may belong to their respective owners.  
- All projects are **static** and should work directly in modern browsers without additional setup.  

---

## 🌟 Future Work  

- Keep adding more mini projects.  
- Build projects that explore **JavaScript interactivity and DOM manipulation**.  
- Experiment with responsive layouts and modern design patterns.
